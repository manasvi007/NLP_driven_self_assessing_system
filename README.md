#NLP driven self assessing system

NLP driven self assessing recruitment training" is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) model that revolutionizes the recruitment process for educational institutions and employers. By scanning student resumes and extracting crucial keywords, the model generates 10 tailored questions that assess the candidate's qualifications and expertise. Each question corresponds to an ideal answer stored in the system's database. As students respond to the questions, LDSART utilizes NLP techniques to evaluate the relevance of their answers, providing a comprehensive assessment based on keyword matches and semantic similarities. The model then computes an overall percentile, offering an objective and fair evaluation of each student's potential. NDSARTstreamlines the screening process, ensures consistency, and eliminates biases, providing students with an efficient and effective method to optimize their resumes and responses.
