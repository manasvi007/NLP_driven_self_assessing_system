**NLP-driven self-assessing system**

NLP-driven self-assessing recruitment training" is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) model that revolutionizes the recruitment process for educational institutions and employers. By scanning student resumes and extracting crucial keywords, the model generates 10 tailored questions that assess the candidate's qualifications and expertise. Each question corresponds to an ideal answer stored in the system's database. As students respond to the questions, LDSART utilizes NLP techniques to evaluate the relevance of their answers, providing a comprehensive assessment based on keyword matches and semantic similarities. The model then computes an overall percentile, offering an objective and fair evaluation of each student's potential. NDSART streamlines the screening process, ensures consistency, and eliminates biases, providing students with an efficient and effective method to optimize their resumes and responses. 

The architecture for the *NLP-driven self-assessing recruitment training system* is given below:

The repository consists of the following folders:
- **Source Code:**
  This folder consists of the source code consisting of the code of the application, providing steps and explanations for all the code snippets. This can be referred to as the working 
  of the application.
  
- **Sample Resume:**
  The Sample Resume folder consists of all the self-curated resumes that can be tested in the application. All the resumes follow a specific format, hence all the resumes were formatted 
  and created for various job roles so that they can be tested against the Source code in the Source Code folder.
  
- **DataSet:**
  The DataSet contains two self-made datasets which are as follows:
  1. **Question-Answer Dataset:**
     The Question Answer is a self-made dataset that contains ample questions related to all the job roles covered along with the ideal answers for every question which are used to 
     compare with the user-entered answers to generate a score.
  
  2. **Skillset Dataset:**
     The Skillset Dataset consists of all the relevant skills to every job role separated with a comma and contained in inverted commas. This helps in comparing whether the user has 
     relevant skills to a job role hence helps in computing the relevancy score for the resume.
